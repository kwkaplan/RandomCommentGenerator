# RandomCommentGenerator
Many schools require instructors to enter in x number of comments every marking period for each student.  While this may be an opportunity to highlight certain student strengths and weaknesses, instructors have generally already addressed strengths and weaknesses with students and guardians, and the process of generating these comments is time-consuming, limiting and arbitrary - but required to satisfy the bureaucratic school administrations.  This application is aimed at making the process of generating these comments quicker and instructors could simply cut and paste generated comments into the relevant grading applications where they would be memorialized.
